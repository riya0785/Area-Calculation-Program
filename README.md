## How to Run??
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. Compile the program using a Java compiler. For example:
   javac Main.java
3. Run the compiled program:
   java Main
4. Follow the on-screen menu to choose a shape and calculate its properties.

## Shape Operations
1. Circle: Calculate area, perimeter, and volume (if applicable).
2. Rectangle: Calculate area, perimeter, and volume (if applicable).
3. Square: Calculate area, perimeter, and volume (if applicable).
4. Sphere: Calculate area and volume.
5. Cylinder: Calculate area and volume.
6. Pyramid: Calculate area and volume.
7. Exit: Quit the program.
   
## Example Usage
1. Choosing option 1 calculates the area and perimeter of a circle.
2. Choosing option 4 calculates the area and volume of a sphere.
   
## Additional Information
1. The program uses an abstract class Shape and interfaces like Volume to model different shapes.
2. Input for dimensions (e.g., radius, length, width) is taken through a simple console interface.
3. The program demonstrates the use of abstract classes, interfaces, and polymorphism.
